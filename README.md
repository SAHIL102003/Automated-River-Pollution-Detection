# Automated-River-Pollution-Detection

**📌 Overview**  
This project utilizes satellite imagery and machine learning to detect river pollution levels. It processes images to classify pollution into four categories, providing insights for environmental monitoring and water quality assessment.  

**🛠️ Tech Stack**  
Machine Learning: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)  
Programming Languages: Python  
Frameworks/Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas  
Dataset: Kaggle (Preprocessed satellite images)  

**🔄 Workflow**  
1️⃣ Data Collection – Satellite images of rivers are gathered from the Kaggle dataset.  
2️⃣ Preprocessing – Images are resized, filtered, and enhanced for model input.  
3️⃣ Model Training – A CNN-based model is trained to classify pollution levels.  
4️⃣ Prediction & Analysis – The model predicts the pollution category of a given image.  
5️⃣ Result Visualization – Pollution levels are displayed for further action.  

**🔹 Impact**  
1️⃣ Automates pollution monitoring without manual inspection.  
2️⃣ Provides accurate pollution assessment for environmental agencies.  
3️⃣ Supports government policies for water resource management.  

**🔹 Applications**  
1️⃣ Environmental Monitoring – Helps track pollution trends over time.  
2️⃣ Water Quality Assessment – Assists in identifying heavily polluted water bodies.  
3️⃣ Smart City Development – Supports clean water initiatives.  

**🚀 Future Enhancements**  
Integration with real-time satellite data for live monitoring.  
Expanding classification to detect specific pollutants.  
Implementing AI-powered alert systems for high pollution levels.
